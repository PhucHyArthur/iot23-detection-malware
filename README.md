# Analysis of IOT-23 Datasets and Machine Learning Models for Malicious Traffic Detection

To run this file, firstly, you need to have a dataset, you can download from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/astralfate/iot23-dataset).

To preprocessing data, you will run in the folder: Preprocessing data

To build model machine learning, you will run un the folder: Models

However, to save your time, i also upload weight model under file pickle, you can find it easily in folder Weight_model
